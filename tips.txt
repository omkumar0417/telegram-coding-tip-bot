1. Always use StringBuilder for concatenating strings inside loops instead of using + operator.
2. Prefer interfaces over abstract classes when designing APIs.
3. Use equals() instead of == when comparing object values in Java.
4. Make class fields private and access them via getters/setters to follow encapsulation.
5. Always override both equals() and hashCode() when using objects in HashMap or HashSet.
6. Use enhanced for loop or streams to simplify iterations over collections.
7. Handle exceptions gracefully using try-catch blocks, never ignore them silently.
8. Always close database connections using try-with-resources or finally block to prevent memory leaks.
9. Mark method parameters final if they should not be modified inside the method.
10. Use @Override annotation to catch errors while overriding methods.
11. Use enums instead of constants to represent fixed sets of values.
12. For multi-threaded apps, prefer using concurrent collections like ConcurrentHashMap.
13. Avoid using raw types; always use generics for type safety.
14. Always provide meaningful toString() implementations for debugging and logging.
15. Use access modifiers wisely to enforce encapsulation and prevent misuse.
16. Avoid using static variables unless truly needed; they stay in memory for entire app lifetime.
17. In switch statements, always add a default case.
18. Prefer composition over inheritance to reduce tight coupling.
19. Use Optional to represent possibly-null return values instead of returning null.
20. For deep comparisons, use Apache Commons Lang EqualsBuilder.
21. Use defensive copies when exposing mutable objects from your class.
22. Avoid initializing variables unnecessarily; use lazy initialization if suitable.
23. Minimize mutability — prefer immutable classes for data objects.
24. Avoid catching generic Exception unless really necessary.
25. Log exceptions with proper stack traces instead of just e.getMessage().
26. Use thread-safe classes like AtomicInteger for counters in multi-threaded code.
27. When overriding equals, use instanceof to ensure type safety.
28. Use Collections.unmodifiableList() to return read-only views.
29. Use Java records (Java 14+) for data classes when immutability is needed.
30. Avoid suppressing exceptions silently in catch blocks.
31. Use streams and lambdas to simplify collection transformations.
32. Always use break in each case of switch to prevent fall-through.
33. Avoid using finalize(); use try-with-resources instead for cleanup.
34. Check for null before calling methods to avoid NullPointerException.
35. Use dependency injection instead of new for better testability.
36. Group related constants using enum instead of final static fields.
37. Keep class files focused — one responsibility per class.
38. Avoid long parameter lists — refactor using parameter objects.
39. Use logger frameworks like SLF4J instead of System.out.println().
40. Use annotations like @Nullable and @NotNull for null safety.
41. Avoid using Date/Calendar directly — use java.time API instead.
42. Use varargs (...) wisely — prefer List for large inputs.
43. Reuse static final constants instead of duplicating string literals.
44. Use assertions for development-time checks, not runtime validation.
45. Cache expensive operations if results are reused frequently.
46. Use method references (Class::method) to simplify stream pipelines.
47. Minimize public fields — hide implementation details.
48. Don’t rely on object finalization for resource cleanup.
49. Avoid exposing internal mutable arrays or collections directly.
50. Profile performance before optimizing — premature optimization is the root of all evil.
