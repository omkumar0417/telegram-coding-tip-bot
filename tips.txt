1. Always use StringBuilder for concatenating strings inside loops instead of using + operator.
2. Prefer interfaces over abstract classes when designing APIs.
3. Use equals() instead of == when comparing object values in Java.
4. Make class fields private and access them via getters/setters to follow encapsulation.
5. Always override both equals() and hashCode() when using objects in HashMap or HashSet.
6. Use enhanced for loop or streams to simplify iterations over collections.
7. Handle exceptions gracefully using try-catch blocks, never ignore them silently.
8. Always close database connections using try-with-resources or finally block to prevent memory leaks.
9. Mark method parameters final if they should not be modified inside the method.
10. Use @Override annotation to catch errors while overriding methods.
